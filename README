posix-extras is an egg for the Chicken Scheme system. It provides some
additional POSIX-y functionality not included with Chicken's own posix
unit.

posix-extras should work on any modern UNIX-like system. It requires
the mkdtemp C library function. It probably won't work on Windows.

posix-extras isn't currently available from the Eggs Unlimited
repository, but you can easily add it to your local set of available
eggs by running "make install" in the project directory. You'll then
be able to (require-extension posix-extras) in your Scheme programs.

posix-extras includes a full set of unit tests. You can run them with
"make test". These tests will create and delete directories in your
filesystem. I recommend that you not run them as root, in case there
are bugs in posix-extras. In fact, the test harness performs a check
to discover whether the tests are being run as the root user; if they
are, the harness will print a message and skip the tests entirely.

The source code for posix-extras is licensed under the MIT license.

Documentation is forthcoming; for now, see the source.
